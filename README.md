# 3D CSS Only Cube
This is my school project for a 6 at the end of the 2nd semester of 3rd class Technikum Akademickie.
It's a lot more difficult than I initally suspected, but also a little fun.
This is also my first time making a GitHub repo, to store this website for future reference and to see how the pro devs do it.
